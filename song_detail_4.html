            Midnight <br />
            You come and pick me up, no headlights <br />
            Long drive <br />
            Could end in burning flames or paradise <br />
            Fade into view, oh <br />
            It's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard <br />
            from you) <br />
            <br />
            <span class="highlight">
              And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I <br />
              Know exactly where it leads, but I <br />
              Watch us go 'round and 'round each time</span
            >
            <br />
            <br />

            You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye <br />
            And I got that red lip classic thing that you like <br />
            And when we go crashing down, we come back every time <br />
            'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style <br />
            You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt <br />
            And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt <br />
            And when we go crashing down, we come back every time <br />
            'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style <br />
            <br />

            So it goes <br />
            He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm <br />
            Takes me home <br />
            The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah <br />
            I say, "I heard, oh <br />
            That you've been out and about with some other girl, some <br />
            other girl" <br />

            He says, "What you heard is true, but I <br />
            Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you and I" <br />

            Taylor Swift redefined pop music and culture on her own terms,     <br>
            seamlessly blending country, pop, and indie-folk through an  <br>
            authentic and expansive lens. The multi-platinum 11X GRAMMY  <br>
            Award winner has become one of the most successful and  <br>
            influential artists of the modern era. 2008's Diamond-certified  <br>
            Fearless established her as a pop phenomenon, with hits like  <br>
            "Love Story" and "You Belong With Me" dominating charts  <br>
            worldwide. Her self-titled debut album in 2006 set the stage for  <br> 
            her meteoric rise. <br> <br>

            In 2014, "Shake It Off" from the 7X Platinum 1989 won "Best Pop  <br>
            Solo Performance" and earned several Grammy nominations.  <br>
            The album itself won "Album of the Year," making Taylor the first  <br> 
            woman to win the award twice for her own solo albums. In 2020,  <br>
            Folklore and Evermore showcased her storytelling prowess,  <br>
            with Folklore winning "Album of the Year" at the Grammys,  <br>
            making her the first female artist to win the award three times.  <br> <br>
            
            Her re-recorded albums, starting with Fearless (Taylor's  <br>
            Version) in 2021, have been a commercial and critical success, <br>  
            reclaiming her artistic legacy. In 2022, Red (Taylor's Version) <br>
            featured the 10-minute version of "All Too Well," which became  <br>
            an instant classic and topped the Billboard Hot 100, setting  <br>
            records for the longest song to ever do so. Taylor's 2019 album  <br>
            Lover marked her third consecutive #1 debut on the Billboard <br>
            200, and "ME!" with Brendon Urie. <br>
