            Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out <br />
            Get some air now, let your edge out <br />
            Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind <br />
            Can you get the heck out? <br />
            I need rest now, got me bummed out <br />
            You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe <br />
            I've been on my empty mind shit <br />
            <br />
            <span class="highlight">
              I try to keep from losin' the rest of me <br />
              I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby <br />
              You don't care <br />
            </span>
            Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent <br />
            Tryna make sense of loose change <br />
            Got me at war in my mind <br />
            Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me <br />
            Choose to watch <br />
            While the world break up and fall on me <br />
            <br />
            All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile <br />
            Still wanna try, still believe in (good days) <br />
            Good days, always (good days) <br />
            Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) <br />
            Good day living in my mind <br />
            <br />
            Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations <br />
            I disappear, if you let me <br />
            Feeling like (on your own) <br />
            Feeling like Jericho <br />
            Feeling like Job when he lost his shit <br />
            Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I <br />

              <h1 class="head">SZA</h1>
              <h2 class="head2">74,228,239 monthly listeners</h2>

          <p class="text2">
            A distinct force in contemporary R&B, SZA has set herself apart <br />
            with a vulnerable and casually poetic songwriting style and a <br />
            voice conveying a multitude of emotions with subtle twists and <br />
            turns. <br />
            <br />
            She established herself with a trio of spaced-out EPs and <br />
            collaborations with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj, and <br />
            Rihanna, and continued her ascent with Ctri (2017), a Top Ten <br />
            album that resulted in five Grammy nominations, including Best <br />
            New Artist. These accolades proved to be no fluke, as SZA <br />
            earned almost as many Grammy nominations the next year by <br />
            assisting Kendrick Lamar with "All the Stars," a Top Ten hit, only <br />
            one in a slew of platinum singles she has scored as a headliner <br />
            or featured artist. <br />
            <br />
            Her rich and complex second album, SOs (2022), went straight <br />
            to number one on the Billboard 200, produced four Top Ten pop <br />
            singles -- including the chart-topping revenge fantasy "Kill Bill" <br />
            --and earned the artist three Grammy awards. <br />
            Sol√°na mani Rowe was born in St. Louis and raised in New <br />
            Jersey, where she excelled in high school gymnastics and <br />
            cheerleading. <br />
            <br />
            After leaving college, Rowe shuffled around different jobs and <br />
            recorded on the side, influenced by the diverse and maverick <br />
            likes of Billie Holiday and Bjork, as well as Wu-Tang Clan, whose <br />
            RZA inspired her performing name. She self-released a pair of <br />
            dreamy and alluring EPs, 2012's See.SZA.Run and 2013's S, and <br />
            shortly thereafter signed with Top Dawg Entertainment. <br />
