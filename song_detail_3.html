            I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through<br />
            I just can't say I don't love you (yeah)<br />
            'Cause I love you, yeah<br />
            It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold<br />
            But tonight, I'm gon' let you know<br />
            Let me tell the truth<br />
            Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br />
            <br />
            <span class="highlight">
              You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br />
              You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br />
              You're scared to be lonely, especially in the night<br />
            </span>
            I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br />
            I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br />
            I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br />
            It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br />
            And I know that you're worth it<br />
            I can't walk away, (oh)<br />
            <br />
            Even though we're going through it<br />
            And it makes you feel alone<br />
            Just know that I would die for you<br />
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br />
            The distance and the time between us<br />
            It'll never change my mind<br />
            'Cause baby, I would die for you<br />
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br />
            <br />
            I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're going<br />
            through<br />
            But baby-girl, I'm not blaming you<br />
